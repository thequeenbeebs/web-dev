  <p><a href="http://www.blairebaker.com"><em>Actor and <strong>Software Engineer</strong></em></a></p>

  <p>I am a software engineer by day, musical theatre performer by night!
    When the COVID-19 pandemic put the entertainment industry at a standstill,
    I was determined to use this time to find another way to use my brain in a
    way I hadn't in quite some time. The journey led me to coding, where I fell
    in love with the dopamine rush of solving a tricky problem. I completed an
    immersive software engineering bootcamp at the Flatiron School, and am
    excited to continue my learning journey. With my background in the arts,
    I bring immense creativity, the ability to empathize and take on the
    perspectives of others, and a laser-sharp focus to the table. I am
    passionate about bettering other peopleâ€™s lives and the world around us
    through code!</p>
