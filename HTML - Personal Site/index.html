        <p>I am a software engineer by day, musical theatre performer by night!
          When the COVID-19 pandemic put the entertainment industry at a standstill,
          I was determined to use this time to find another way to use my brain in a
          way I hadn't in quite some time. The journey led me to coding, where I fell
          in love with the dopamine rush of solving a tricky problem. I completed an
          immersive software engineering bootcamp at the Flatiron School, and am
          excited to continue my learning journey. With my background in the arts,
          I bring immense creativity, the ability to empathize and take on the
          perspectives of others, and a laser-sharp focus to the table. I am
          passionate about bettering other people’s lives and the world around us
          through code!</p>
